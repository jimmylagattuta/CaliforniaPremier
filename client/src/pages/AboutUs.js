            <p>
              Our mission is to work with you in reducing your level of pain and
              suffering, getting you back to your highest level of independence
              and functioning, and improving the quality of your life.

            <h3>How We Can Help You</h3>
            <p>
              California Premier Pain Clinics experts will create a treatment
              plan that is individually tailored to your condition and degree of
              discomfort. Your treatment plan may include a single strategy or a
              mix of medical therapies, such as prescription medications,
              surgical procedures, and rehabilitation therapies.

            <p>
              There is no question that putting the right procedure on the right
              structures will create the best outcome. All of our injections are
              done under either ultrasound or fluoroscopic guidance. Certain
              structures are best imaged under fluoroscopy and others are best
              imaged with ultrasound. The best outcomes happen when treatments
              are performed with precision.
